Step Label the bottle
    Write Cellobiose M9 Media on a label, stick it to the bottle.

Step Add 25 mL of DI water to a 50 mL Falcon tube.
    Use the DI water near the sink.

Step Transfer 100 uL of Calcium Chloride to the 50 mL Falcon tube
    Use the serological pipettor and a 2 mL serological pipette.
    After aspirating, be sure to wipe as much Calcium Chloride off of the outside of the pipette as possible.
    Dispense as much Calcium Chloride as possible, then wait 30 seconds, and dispense whatever Calcium Chloride drains to the bottom of the pipette. (?)
    - If anything participated out of the solution, you'll need to discard whatever was made in this protocol, make new CaCl2 1M solution, and start this protocol over.  

Step Transfer 1 mL of Magnesium Sulfate to the 50 mL Falcon tube
    Use the serological pipettor and a 2 mL serological pipette.
    After aspirating, be sure to wipe as much Magnesium Sulfate off of the outside of the pipette as possible.
    Dispense as much Magnesium Sulfate as possible, then wait 30 seconds, and dispense whatever Magnesium Sulfate drains to the bottom of the pipette. (?)
    - If anything participated out of the solution, you'll need to discard whatever was made in this protocol, make new MgS04 1M solution, and start this protocol over.

Step Measure 2 g of Cellobiose
    - Place the plastic boat on the scale.
    - Zero the scale.
    - Using the spatula, measure 2 g of Cellobiose into the plastic boat and add it to the tube.

Step Add 10 mL of 1% Biotin 100x (0.01% to the 50 mL Falcon tube

Step Add DI water to the Falcon tube until the volume is ~50 mL.
    Use the DI water near the sink.

Step Mix.
    Put a cap on the tube and shake to mix the dry ingredients with the water.
    Dry off the tube with a paper towel. Place the tube in location TBD.

Step Add 500 mL of DI water to the labled 1000 mL bottle.
    Use the DI water near the sink.

Step Use a 30 mL Syringe and aspirate as much solution as possible from the 50 mL Falcon tube.
    - Connect a Syringe Filter to the end of the Syringe.
    - Expel the solution into the labled 1000 mL bottle.
    - Repeat until all of the original solution within the 50 mL Falcon tube is in the 1000 mL bottle.

Step Add 200 mL of sterile M9 Salts 5x to the 1000 mL bottle.

Step Add DI water to the 1000 mL bottle until the total volume is ~1000 mL.
    Use the DI water near the sink.

Step Store at 4C.
