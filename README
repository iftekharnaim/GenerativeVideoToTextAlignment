This directory contains the source codes and datasets for unsupervised alignment of natural language instructions with corresponding video segments. The mathematical models are explained in our AAAI-2014 paper[1].


Data:
=====

The directory "dataset_aaai14" contains the datasets used for our AAAI-14 paper. There are 3 directories: protocols, video_blobs, and vision_3d_coord.

Directory “protocols” - contains the raw text and parses for 3 wetlab protocols: CELL, LLGM, and YPAD.

Directory “video_blobs” - contains the annotations of the set of blobs touched by hands in the videos. There are total 6 videos (2 per protocol). The files that contains “vision” in their name are generated by automated tracking. The files that do not have “vision” in their name (and upper case) are the manual tracking data via Anvil.

Directory “vision_3d_coord” - X, Y, Z coordinates for the tracked objects.


Code:
=====

This implementation includes the source codes for 4 different alignment models as described in [1]. The instructions for running each of the methods are explained below:


Run HMM1 model (monotonic)
==========================

On Anvil data:
> python hmm_multivideos.py False True

On Vision data:
> python hmm_multivideos.py False False


Run HMM2 (non-monotonic)
========================

On Anvil data:
> python hmm_multivideos.py True True

On Vision data:
> python hmm_multivideos.py True False


Run LHMM1 (monotonic, unobserved)
================================

On Anvil data:
> python latent_hmm_multivideos.py False True

On Vision data:
> python latent_hmm_multivideos.py False False

Run LHMM2 (non-monotonic, unobserved)
================================

On Anvil data:
> python latent_hmm_multivideos.py True True

On Vision data:
> python latent_hmm_multivideos.py True False


NOTE:
======

We extended the generative alignment model using discriminative Latent CRF model in [2]. Please note that the code in this repository does NOT include the source codes for the discriminative models. We’ll soon release that source codes for the discriminative models separately.
